# Python-PandasRefresher
This is my work following a video tutorial from youtube as a refresher for my pandas with python 3
the data i used was the same from the source tutorial and the data is a collection of some of the Pokemon details in one table 
i make file to read and find data from a panda data utlizing different functions/methods (analysiscynRead.py)
the main file is (analysiscyn.py) in this file i write and alter the data frame with different method/functions
(analysiscynAdv.py) in this file I work on filtering text anfd changing text using conditional statements, aggrigate, groupby, and some stats
    and read by size of file to practice for larger files read in a smaller amount at a time
